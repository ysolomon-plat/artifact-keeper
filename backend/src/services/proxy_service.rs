///
/// Backend-specific notes (#895 perf review):
///
/// * **S3 backend.** `object_store::WriteMultipart` allocates an
///   additional ~10 MiB part buffer on top of this 4 MiB tee cap, so
///   the actual per-request peak on the S3 path is ~14 MiB rather
///   than 4 MiB. Still a >35× reduction vs. the 500 MiB+ buffered
///   path.
/// * **Upstream backpressure.** When storage falls behind, this
///   channel fills; `tx.send().await` blocks, which stops draining
///   the `reqwest::bytes_stream`, which closes the TCP window to
///   upstream. This is the correct backpressure for OOM relief, but
///   it can hold an upstream socket open longer than the buffered
///   path did. Mirrors with aggressive per-connection idle timeouts
///   (Maven Central, dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org) may close the
///   connection if storage fsync exceeds the mirror's idle window.
///   The `http_client::base_client_builder()` read timeout caps the
///   total wait; operators with tight storage budgets should verify
///   that timeout matches their upstream's tolerance.
/// * **HTTP/2 client flow-control window (#1184).** The 4 MiB tee cap
///   bounds memory between upstream reader and storage writer, but
///   on the *client* side hyper's HTTP/2 flow-control window adds
///   another in-flight slice that is NOT part of this channel.
///   With reqwest's current defaults this codebase does not call
///   `http2_adaptive_window`, so the per-stream window is fixed at
///   `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` (64 KiB). One in-flight frame
///   bounded by `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` (peer-advertised, default
///   16 KiB, ceiling 16 MiB) sits on top of the window, so the
///   per-stream HTTP/2 overhead is conservatively ~128 KiB under
///   default tuning. Practical worst case under the documented
///   1 GiB pod limit is ~10 concurrent slow HTTP/2 clients =
///   ~1.3 MiB on top of the ~14 MiB per-request peak above, i.e.
///   ~15 MiB total. Well within budget; operators sizing pod memory
///   should still account for the per-stream window when calculating
///   concurrency limits, not just `TEE_CHANNEL_DEPTH * chunk_size`.
