    // DB-backed coverage for the synth-id acknowledge path. These tests
    // require a live `DATABASE_URL` (provided by CI's coverage job, which
    // seeds Postgres + applies migrations before `cargo llvm-cov --lib`).
    // Locally they no-op when `DATABASE_URL` is unset, so `cargo test --lib`
    // stays green without Postgres.
    //
    // What we cover:
    //   * Happy path Acknowledged: writes `is_acknowledged = true`,
    //     populates the audit fields, and re-reads the synth aggregate.
    //   * Happy path FalsePositive: collapses to `true` on `scan_findings`
    //     (the table has no separate column), reason field carries the
    //     audit distinction.
    //   * Happy path Open: clears acknowledgement back to false and nulls
    //     the audit fields (mirror of the revoke endpoint).
    //   * Validation: `Fixed` is unrepresentable on `scan_findings`, so the
    //     service surfaces `AppError::Validation` rather than silently
    //     coercing.
    //   * Not-found: no matching `scan_findings` rows for (artifact, cve)
    //     produces `AppError::NotFound` (handler maps that to 404).
    //   * Case-insensitive CVE match: lower/upper-case CVE strings on
    //     either side of the comparison must still find the row.
    //   * Multi-row aggregate: when two findings share (artifact, cve), the
    //     update touches both, the post-write aggregate uses MIN/MAX of
    //     detection timestamps, and `all_acknowledged` reflects both rows.
