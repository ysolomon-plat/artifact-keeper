//! Shared input validation helpers.
//!
//! Centralizes URL and other validation logic used across multiple handlers
//! and services so that SSRF / injection rules are defined in one place.
//!
//! # Defense layers
//!
//! 1. [`validate_outbound_url`] is the entry point for handlers/services that
//!    receive a URL from a client (e.g. webhook URL, remote repo URL,
//!    upstream config.json `dl` field). Reject before the request ever
//!    issues.
//! 2. The redirect policy on the shared HTTP client (see
//!    `crate::services::http_client::base_client_builder`) calls
//!    [`is_blocked_url`] on every redirect hop. This closes the
//!    redirect-follow bypass — without it, an upstream returning
//!    `302 Location: http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` would defeat layer 1.
//! 3. Egress NetworkPolicy at the cluster layer is a defense-in-depth
//!    follow-up tracked separately.
//!
//! # Residual gaps
//!
//! DNS rebinding: a hostname that resolves to a public IP at validation
//! time and a private IP at fetch time is not caught by string-based
//! validation. Mitigation requires a custom DNS resolver or pinning the
//! resolved IP via `reqwest`'s `resolve_to_addrs`. Tracked as a follow-up.
