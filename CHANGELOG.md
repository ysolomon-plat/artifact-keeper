## [Unreleased]

### Pre-upgrade check

- **Stuck-scan janitor will reap accumulated `running` rows on first tick** (#1015, #1062) -- v1.1.10 introduces a background janitor that transitions `scan_results` rows wedged in `status='running'` past the configured `STUCK_SCAN_THRESHOLD_SECS` (default 1800s / 30 min) to `status='failed'`. On long-running installs predating v1.1.10, previously-stuck rows from crashed scan workers (OOM, pod evicted, deploy mid-scan) will flip to `failed` in batches of up to 1000 rows per janitor tick (the per-tick cap bounds memory and audit-log write volume). With the default `STUCK_SCAN_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS=600`, a backlog of N stuck rows therefore takes roughly `ceil(N / 1000) * (STUCK_SCAN_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS / 60)` minutes per replica to fully drain. Multiple janitor-running replicas drain proportionally faster (the cap is per-replica, per-tick). Operators with a large backlog who want to accelerate the drain can lower `STUCK_SCAN_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS` for one or two ticks after deploy and revert. Alerting on `status='failed'` deltas should expect this drain (one or many ticks depending on backlog size) at upgrade and tune accordingly.

  Count the rows that will be reaped before upgrading:

  ```sql
  SELECT count(*) FROM scan_results
  WHERE status = 'running'
    AND started_at < now() - interval '30 min';
  ```

  The same count also approximates migration `076_partial_index_running_scans.sql`'s ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock duration on `scan_results` — the partial index is built non-concurrently (forced by sqlx's per-migration transaction wrapper), and the build scan touches every `running` row that exists at migration time. New `scan_results` inserts block on that lock for the build's duration. On installs with a small backlog the build is sub-second; on installs with hundreds of thousands of historical stuck rows the build can take seconds-to-tens-of-seconds. Plan the upgrade window using the count above.

  Each reap also writes one `SCAN_REAPED` entry to `audit_log` (#1063) carrying the `scan_id`, `artifact_id`, `repository_id`, `started_at`, `reaped_at`, and `threshold_secs` so the burst is auditable. Note that `audit_log` entries are subject to the `audit_retention_days` retention sweep (default 90 days), and the `scan_results` row itself is `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `artifacts`/`repositories`; for long-term compliance retention, export `SCAN_REAPED` entries to durable SIEM storage rather than relying on either table as the long-term source of truth. Artifacts whose vulnerability scan was reaped this way are now visible to operators investigating an incident; rescan with `POST /api/v1/security/artifacts/{id}/rescan` if the scan never reported findings.

### Added

- **Stuck-scan janitor partial index** (#1061) -- migration `076_partial_index_running_scans.sql` adds `idx_scan_results_running_started ON scan_results (started_at) WHERE status = 'running'`. The janitor sweep added in #1015 filters on `status='running'` without a `repository_id` predicate, which would degrade on installs with very large `scan_results` tables. The partial index only contains in-flight rows so the planner goes straight to the candidates. `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is intentionally not used because `sqlx::migrate` runs each migration in a transaction; in-flight rows are bounded by the janitor itself so the synchronous build is short.
- **Audit-event emission on stuck-scan reap** (#1063) -- `ScanResultService::cleanup_stuck_scans` now writes one `SCAN_REAPED` entry to `audit_log` per reaped row, capturing `scan_id`, `artifact_id`, `repository_id`, `started_at`, `reaped_at`, `threshold_secs`, and `reason='stuck_running_janitor'` in the `details` JSON column. Previously the janitor emitted only the `ak_cleanup_items_removed_total{type="stuck_scans"}` counter, so operators investigating an incident could not tell which vulnerability scans never completed. Audit writes are best-effort: a failure to record the event is logged at warn level but does not roll back the reap, since leaving the row wedged in `running` is the worse outcome. Adds `AuditAction::ScanReaped` and `ResourceType::ScanResult`.
- **Auth: `RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT_USERNAMES` env var** -- comma-separated list of usernames exempt from auth and API rate limiting. Backported from #697 to address bcrypt-cost-12 verification saturation under burst auth in release-gate test suites: shared `admin` logins on every request would saturate the `spawn_blocking` pool and surface as transient 401/429s in conan-packages, default-credentials, totp-backup-codes and similar suites. Set in deployment values to bypass the in-process limiter for shared accounts in CI/test environments. The companion `RATE_LIMIT_EXEMPT_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS` flag exempts every service-account principal when set to `true`/`1`. Exempt requests carry an `X-RateLimit-Exempt: true` response header.
- **Webhooks: deliveries now fire** (#909) -- a new background producer subscribes to the in-process EventBus and writes a row into `webhook_deliveries` for every enabled webhook whose `events` array contains the matching event and whose `repository_id` is NULL (global) or matches the event's repository scope. The existing retry scheduler picks these rows up on its 30-second tick and performs the HTTP POST. Before this change the `webhook_deliveries` table was read by the retry scheduler and the list endpoints but no code path inserted into it, so subscribers received nothing. Existing subscribers will start receiving events on deploy with no configuration change. Webhook delivery uses at-most-once semantics: if the broadcast channel lags, dropped events are logged at warn-level and cannot be replayed by the producer; operators needing replay should use the `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries/{delivery_id}/redeliver` endpoint. Repository scoping for `user.*`, `build.*`, and `artifact.*` events is approximate because `DomainEvent.entity_id` is the entity UUID rather than the owning repo UUID; for those events only global-scoped subscriptions (`repository_id IS NULL`) match. Tracked as #948 for v1.2.0.
- **Auth: download-ticket consumer middleware** (#930) -- the `?ticket=<v>` query parameter minted by `POST /api/v1/auth/ticket` is now accepted as a fallback authenticator on read routes (`auth_middleware`, `optional_auth_middleware`, and `repo_visibility_middleware`). Tickets are single-use, expire after 30 seconds, are restricted to GET/HEAD methods, and only authenticate the request whose URL path matches the ticket's bound `resource_path`. Useful for browser anchor-tag downloads and `EventSource` SSE streams where `Authorization` headers cannot be set.

### Security

- **Webhook signature header is a placeholder in v1.1.9** (#909, #910) -- webhook deliveries in v1.1.9 ship a placeholder `X-Webhook-Signature` header with the literal value `hmac-signature`. Real HMAC-SHA256 signing requires encrypted-at-rest secret storage that is deferred to v1.1.10 (#910). Receivers MUST NOT validate or trust the signature header value in v1.1.9. Operators should restrict webhook receiver URLs to internal/trusted endpoints until v1.1.10.
- **Webhook write handlers now require admin role** -- `POST /api/v1/webhooks` (create), `DELETE /api/v1/webhooks/{id}` (delete), `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/enable`, `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/disable`, `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/test`, and `POST /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries/{delivery_id}/redeliver` are now gated on `admin_middleware`. Previously gated on any authenticated user, which allowed low-privileged accounts to register webhooks for events on repositories they could not read (cross-tenant info disclosure via global webhooks where `repository_id = NULL`). Pre-existing flaw exposed by #909 making webhook delivery functional for the first time. Read endpoints (`GET /api/v1/webhooks`, `GET /api/v1/webhooks/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries`) remain accessible to any authenticated user.
- **API-token cache invalidation on user deactivation** (#931) -- when an admin deactivates or deletes a user (`PATCH /api/v1/users/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/{id}`), updates a service account (`PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/service-accounts/{id}`), or runs a federated SSO offboarding sync (`AuthService::deactivate_missing_users`), every cached API-token validation belonging to that user or service account is now rejected immediately rather than continuing to authenticate for up to 5 minutes (the previous `API_TOKEN_CACHE_TTL_SECS` window). Caveat: the invalidation map is per-process. In multi-replica deployments (Helm `replicas > 1`) only the replica that handled the admin action evicts immediately; other replicas still reject the cached entry within the same 5-minute window via the existing `WHERE is_active = true` SQL filter, but cache hits on those replicas can still authenticate during that window. A v1.2.0 follow-up will move the signal into the database or a Redis pub-sub channel so it is observed by every replica.
- **Scanner silent-success on type-mismatched artifacts** (#994) -- when the requested scan_type did not apply to the artifact format (e.g. `ImageScanner` against an npm tarball, `IncusScanner` against an OCI image, `OpenScapScanner` against a `.whl`), the scanner short-circuited and the orchestrator persisted a `scan_results` row with `status='completed'`, `findings_count=0`, `scanner_version=NULL`, and `error_message=NULL`. The rows are indistinguishable from a real clean scan, so quality gates and external tooling treating these as "scan completed clean" auto-promoted unscanned artifacts. The release-gate `tests/security/test-scan-completes.sh` flagged this on a `lodash 4.17.4` fixture (multiple known CVEs) that produced `findings_count=0` with `completed_at - started_at = 2.8ms`, far too short for a real Trivy scan.

  **Fixed in v1.1.9** by introducing `Scanner::is_applicable(&Artifact, Option<&ArtifactMetadata>) -> bool` on the `Scanner` trait (defaults to `true` so the always-on dependency and Grype scanners are unaffected) and gating `scan_results` row creation on it in `ScannerService::scan_artifact_with_options`. Non-applicable scanners now leave no DB trace, so a `completed` row is a real signal that the scanner ran. Scan-time short-circuits inside each scanner are kept as defense in depth for direct callers and tests. Migration 075 adds a `legacy_unverified` boolean column to `scan_results` and flags existing buggy rows (status='completed' AND scanner_version IS NULL AND findings_count=0 AND error_message empty). Consumer queries in `policy_service`, `promotion_policy_service`, `promotion_rule_service`, `scan_result_service::find_reusable_scan`, `scan_result_service::recalculate_score`, and `sbom::extract_dependencies_for_artifact` now filter `legacy_unverified = false`, so flagged rows are treated as if they do not exist (the `block_unscanned` policy continues to block, promotion rules read no counts, dedup will not reuse a legacy row).

  **Operators upgrading from v1.1.0-v1.1.8 must audit and rescan** affected artifacts after deploying v1.1.9. Migration 075 runs automatically on startup; once it has run, audit with:

  ```sql
  SELECT artifact_id, scan_type, COUNT(*) AS legacy_rows
  FROM scan_results
  WHERE legacy_unverified = true
  GROUP BY artifact_id, scan_type
  ORDER BY legacy_rows DESC;
  ```

  Re-scan affected artifacts via `POST /api/v1/security/artifacts/{id}/rescan`, or trigger a repository-wide rescan from the admin UI. Artifacts with only legacy rows are now treated as unscanned by `block_unscanned` policies and will be blocked at download until a real scan completes.

### Fixed

- **PyPI: simple index now normalizes package names per PEP 503** (#798) -- packages with underscores, dots, or mixed case are now normalized to lowercase hyphens in the simple index, and lookups are case-insensitive.
- **npm: version-specific metadata endpoint** (#799) -- `GET /npm/{repo}/{package}/{version}` now returns the specific version object extracted from the packument, supporting both regular and scoped packages.
- **Go, Terraform, Swift: return 404 for nonexistent resources** (#800) -- version listings and release lookups for modules/packages that don't exist now return 404 instead of an empty 200. Empty repositories still work correctly.
- **Conda native: .conda package format key corrected** (#801) -- `derive_format_key()` was producing `"condanative"` instead of `"conda_native"` for multi-word format variants, breaking format handler registration. Also affects `wasm_oci` and `helm_oci`.
- **HuggingFace: long model name validation** (#802) -- model names over 255 characters, revisions over 255 characters, or paths over 2036 characters now return 400 with a descriptive error instead of a 500 database constraint violation.
- **Conan: revision count no longer inflated** (#803) -- uploading multiple files to the same recipe revision (conanfile.py, conanmanifest.txt, conan_export.tgz) now correctly counts as one revision, not three. The revisions query uses GROUP BY on the revision hash.

### Thank You

- @slai-eddie for the Conan files-listing endpoints and handler coverage improvements (#782, #790)

### Added

- **Conan recipe files-listing endpoint** -- `GET /conan/{repo}/v2/conans/{name}/{ver}/{user}/{channel}/revisions/{rev}/files` returns a JSON listing of all files in a recipe revision, matching the Conan v2 protocol spec.
- **Conan package files-listing endpoint** -- `GET .../packages/{pkg_id}/revisions/{prev}/files` returns the same for package binary revisions.

### Fixed

- **Conan search returns wrong metadata** -- search results now use the actual `version`, `user`, and `channel` values from artifact metadata instead of falling back to column defaults, which could show incorrect references.
- **Conan recipe latest revision unstable ordering** -- when multiple revisions share the same timestamp, the latest endpoint now uses `id DESC` as a tiebreaker for deterministic results.
- **Conan package latest revision unstable ordering** -- same tiebreaker fix applied to the package latest endpoint.
- **Conan package re-upload fails with 500** -- uploading a file to the same package revision now properly cleans up the soft-deleted previous version before inserting, preventing unique constraint violations. Recipe uploads already had this cleanup; package uploads were missing it.

### Changed

- **Conan handler deduplication** -- replaced 13 inline database/storage error-mapping closures with shared `map_db_err` and `map_storage_err` helpers, reducing code by ~200 lines while preserving identical behavior.

### Thank You

- @jamie-kemp for reporting the backup path length failure (#758)

### Fixed

- **Backups fail on long artifact paths** (#758) -- backup exports crashed with "provided value is too long when setting path" for proxy-cached Maven artifacts with deep coordinates. The tar builder now uses `append_data()` which handles paths over 100 characters via GNU LongLink entries.

### Thank You

- @Firjens for reporting npm Content-Type causing empty SBOMs (#722), scan status masking (#723), Docker unauth repo failure (#744), and npm pull-through integrity loss (#745)
- @roblabla for reporting proxy OOM under parallel requests (#737)
- @agangadharan-navaera for reporting migration pagination beyond 100 artifacts (#671)
- @Dreamacro for reporting APT remote proxy missing InRelease/Release files (#674)

### Fixed

- **npm tarballs stored with wrong Content-Type** (#722) -- npm .tgz files are now stored with `application/gzip` instead of `application/octet-stream`, fixing empty SBOM results and failed security scans on npm artifacts.
- **Scan status masked extraction errors as "clean"** (#723) -- all four vulnerability scanners (Grype, Trivy, OpenSCAP, Incus) now propagate errors instead of returning empty findings, so the UI shows the real failure instead of a misleading clean status.
- **Docker pull from public repos required authentication** (#744) -- the OCI/Docker handler now issues an anonymous pull token when no credentials are provided, allowing unauthenticated `docker pull` from repositories marked as public.
- **npm pull-through cache served wrong package tarball** (#745) -- tarball lookups now include the package name in the path pattern, preventing cross-package collisions when two packages produce the same filename (e.g., `mdurl` vs `@types/mdurl`).
- **Proxy OOM under concurrent requests** (#737) -- added a concurrent fetch semaphore (`PROXY_MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES`, default 10) and artifact size limit (`PROXY_MAX_ARTIFACT_SIZE_BYTES`, default 2 GB) to prevent unbounded memory growth when proxying many large artifacts in parallel.
- **Migration pagination beyond 100 artifacts** (#671) -- the migration artifact enumeration now paginates correctly, fixing imports from Artifactory instances with more than 100 artifacts per repository.
- **APT remote proxy missing metadata** (#674) -- APT remote repositories now proxy `InRelease`, `Release`, `Release.gpg`, and `Packages` files from upstream, fixing `apt update` failures.
- **Backup service wrong table name** (#742) -- corrected `download_stats` to `download_statistics` and `repository_permissions` to `permission_grants` in the backup export queries.
- **Cargo pull-through registry dl URL resolution** (#743) -- the Cargo download handler now resolves the `dl` URL from the upstream registry's `config.json` instead of assuming a fixed path pattern, fixing pull-through for registries with non-standard download URLs.

### Security

- Updated rustls-webpki 0.103.10 to 0.103.12 (RUSTSEC-2026-0098, RUSTSEC-2026-0099)

### Thank You

- @feicipet for reporting the Maven checksum validation failure on virtual repos (#660)
- @ReneBeszon for reporting the Nexus migration stall (#654) and npm virtual repo metadata issue (#652)
- @m1m1x for reporting the APK remote repo multi-version failure (#653)
- @thonby for reporting the OIDC redirect_uri issue behind reverse proxies (#655)
- @jamie-kemp for reporting the Go proxy `go get` failure (#651)

### Fixed
- **Maven checksum 404 on virtual repos** (#660) - checksum requests (.sha1, .md5, .sha256) through virtual Maven repositories now traverse member repos and proxy from upstream, matching the behavior of artifact downloads.
- **Migration assessment stalls forever** (#654) - the assessment handler now spawns a background worker to run the assessment. Previously it set the job status to "assessing" but never executed the work. Assessment results are stored and retrievable via the GET endpoint.
- **APK remote proxy 500 across Alpine versions** (#653) - when a proxy-cached artifact's storage key is inaccessible, the handler now falls through to re-fetch from upstream instead of returning HTTP 500.
- **OIDC redirect_uri behind reverse proxy** (#655, #657) - the redirect URI is now constructed as an absolute URL using the request's Host header, fixing Keycloak/OIDC callbacks that failed when running behind a reverse proxy.
- **npm virtual repo metadata for local members** (#652, #659) - virtual npm repositories now include metadata from local and staging member repos, not just remote members.
- **Go proxy sumdb verification paths** (#651, #658) - `go get` through proxy repos no longer fails with "Bad Request" when the Go toolchain requests sumdb verification paths.

### Dependencies
- quick-xml 0.39.0 -> 0.39.2
- zip 2.4.2 -> 8.5.1
- docker/login-action 4.0.0 -> 4.1.0
- aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials 6.0.0 -> 6.1.0

- @Kimahriman for five high-quality bug reports: PyPI relative URL handling for Nexus/devpi remotes (#610), NPM scoped package encoding for private registries (#616), PyPI remote vs virtual divergence (#625), PyPI proxy cache misses (#603), and PyPI virtual download delegation (#602)
- @andrlange for four OCI/Docker bugs: manifest push error handling (#594, #595, #596) and API token auth on /v2/token (#593)
- @mtatheonly for reporting that remote repos don't list cached packages (#624)
- @gaetanmetzger for the Docker Hub remote proxy support request that led to the token exchange feature (#612)
- @ivolnistov for the SSO admin permissions fix PR (#609) and the SSO bug report (#608)
- @todpunk for the metrics endpoint feature (#571) and clippy docs fix (#572)
- @arnaudmut for reporting the Trivy image tag issue (#585)

- @Lerentis for continued testing on the Maven S3 upload issue (#361)
- @msegura501 for the Caddy proxy env var fix (#445)

### Added
- **OCI bearer token exchange** (#612, #626) - remote Docker/OCI repos now handle the 401/token handshake required by Docker Hub, GHCR, and private registries. Tokens are cached in memory with TTL-based eviction. Includes SSRF validation on token endpoint URLs.
- **Chunked/resumable upload API** (#563, #564) - new `/api/v1/uploads` endpoints for multi-GB file uploads. Supports configurable chunk sizes (1 MB to 256 MB), SHA-256 verification, session expiry cleanup, and resume after interruption.
- **Upstream authentication for remote repositories** (#451) - remote (proxy) repos can now authenticate against private upstream registries using Basic or Bearer credentials. Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- **ALLOW_LOCAL_ADMIN_LOGIN env var** (#443) - break-glass recovery mechanism that allows the built-in admin account to log in with local credentials even when SSO is configured.
- **Optional unauthenticated metrics endpoint** (#571) - contributed by @todpunk. Configurable via `METRICS_PORT` for Prometheus scraping without auth.
- **Proxy-cached artifacts in repo listings** (#624, #626) - artifacts fetched through remote proxy repos are now recorded in the database, making them visible in repository listings and storage size calculations.
- **Docker compose guide comments** (#448) - inline guidance explaining each service, what is optional, and what to change for production.

### Fixed
- **PyPI relative URL resolution** (#610, #622) - registries like Sonatype Nexus, devpi, and Artifactory that use relative hrefs in their simple index HTML now work correctly. URLs are resolved using the `url` crate's RFC 3986-compliant Url::join method.
- **PyPI virtual/direct remote parity** (#625, #627) - virtual repos now use the exact same remote proxy logic as direct remote access, including content-type preservation, conditional URL rewriting, and proxy cache checks.
- **NPM scoped package encoding for remotes** (#616, #622) - scoped packages (`@scope/pkg`) are now URL-encoded (`@scope%2Fpkg`) in upstream requests per the npm registry wire protocol. Private registries (Nexus, Verdaccio, GitHub Packages) that require the encoded form now work.
- **Chunked upload security hardening** (#621) - six P0 bugs fixed: memory-safe file streaming on complete (C1), bounded chunk body buffering (C2), session ownership verification (C3), strengthened path traversal validation (C4), total_size validation (C5), atomic chunk claim to prevent race conditions (C6).
- **SSRF protection hardening** (#622) - SSRF blocklist now rejects single-label hostnames and `.svc.cluster.local` Kubernetes addresses. Resolved URLs from upstream index pages are validated before fetch. Non-HTTP schemes rejected after relative URL resolution.
- **SSO admin permissions preserved on login** (#608, #609) - when an SSO user with admin permissions logs in and no admin group pattern matches, their existing admin flag is no longer reset. Contributed by @ivolnistov.
- **S3 ECS/EKS credential chain** (#613, #617) - switched to `AmazonS3Builder::from_env()` so ECS task roles, EKS IRSA, and instance profiles are automatically detected.
- **OCI manifest push bugs** (#594, #595, #596, #600) - three fixes: re-push after delete clears `is_deleted`, INSERT errors are no longer silently swallowed, and duplicate image name in log lines is resolved.
- **Docker /v2/token accepts API tokens** (#593, #599) - service account API tokens can now be used as Basic Auth passwords for Docker login.
- **Revoked tokens excluded from listings** (#592, #598) - service account token listing no longer includes revoked tokens.
- **Trivy image pinned** (#585, #597) - Docker image uses `ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy:0.69.3` instead of the removed `latest` tag.
- **S3 PUT errors surface response body** (#361) - S3 rejection details (e.g. 403 AccessDenied) now appear in error messages and structured logs.
- **Virtual repo members displayed in UI** (#455, #461) - fixed member panel rendering and OpenAPI spec field mismatch.
- **Caddy proxy env var interference** (#445) - cleared inherited Docker daemon proxy env vars on the Caddy service.
- **OCI Basic Auth on /v2 endpoint** (#457) - the `/v2/` version check endpoint now accepts Basic Auth in addition to Bearer tokens.
- **SSO login redirect URLs** (#454) - corrected OIDC/SAML callback URLs and added LDAP custom CA certificate support.

### Security
- **OIDC ID token signature verification** (#590) - validates ID token signatures via JWKS, plus nonce/iss/aud/exp claims.
- **SSRF protection on repository upstream URLs** (#590) - `validate_outbound_url` blocks private IPs, cloud metadata endpoints, and internal hostnames.
- **NPM package name validation** (#622) - decoded package names are validated for null bytes, path traversal, slash count, and length.
- **Chunked upload path traversal hardening** (#621) - rejects null bytes, backslashes, percent-encoded traversal, bare dot components, and double slashes.

### Performance
- **CI pipeline 60% faster** (#591) - sccache, dependency caching, and parallel jobs cut PR check time significantly.
- **Regex compilation moved to statics** (#622) - three per-request `Regex::new()` calls in PyPI handler replaced with `once_cell::sync::Lazy` statics.
- **N+1 download stats query eliminated** (#590) - batch query replaces per-artifact loop in artifact listing.

## [1.1.0-rc.8] - 2026-03-17

### Thank You
- @inspired-geek (Alexey Ivanov) for three quality contributions: paginated Dependency-Track list endpoints preventing truncated security data (#434), paginated Meilisearch reindex preventing OOM on large registries (#435/#440), advisory cache eviction with error visibility (#433/#439), S3 status code handling (#410), and Cargo sparse index field name fix (#419)
- @pipelineRat for reporting Maven pull-through cache failures (#427)
- @dispalt for continued feedback on storage backend behavior (#428)

### Added
- **Per-repository storage backend selection** (#431) - repositories can now be configured to use different storage backends (filesystem, S3, Azure, GCS) independently of the global default.
- **Correlation ID middleware** (#432) - every HTTP response now includes an `X-Correlation-ID` header for distributed tracing. The middleware was previously defined with 13 unit tests but never wired into the router.
- **Configurable rate limits** (#436) - auth and API rate limits are now configurable via `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_PER_MIN` (default 120), `RATE_LIMIT_API_PER_MIN` (default 5000), and `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECS` (default 60) environment variables.

### Fixed
- **bcrypt blocking the async runtime** (#436) - moved all `bcrypt::verify` and `bcrypt::hash` calls to `tokio::task::spawn_blocking()`. Previously, bcrypt at cost-12 (~250ms per call) ran synchronously on the tokio event loop, serializing all concurrent requests. At 5 concurrent logins, max latency was 2.7s. Now runs on the blocking thread pool.
- **Rate limiter shared bucket in Kubernetes** (#436) - without `ConnectInfo`, all clients shared a single `ip:unknown` rate limit bucket. Now falls back to `X-Forwarded-For` from trusted ingress controllers. Auth rate limit raised from 30 to 120 req/min (bcrypt cost-12 already provides brute-force protection).
- **Sync policy create doesn't auto-evaluate** (#438) - creating, updating, deleting, or toggling a sync policy now automatically calls `evaluate_policies()` to populate `peer_repo_subscriptions`. Previously, uploads after policy creation wouldn't trigger sync tasks until a manual `/evaluate` call.
- **Maven SNAPSHOT timestamp treated as classifier** (#432) - `strip_snapshot_timestamp()` now correctly strips timestamp-build suffixes (e.g., `-20260314.155654-1`) from SNAPSHOT filenames so they aren't misidentified as classifiers.
- **Maven SNAPSHOT re-upload not updating primary** (#432) - when a new SNAPSHOT build replaces an existing primary artifact, the artifact record now correctly updates path, checksum, and storage key.
- **Dependency-Track truncated results** (#434) - list endpoints now paginate through all results instead of returning only the first page. Contributed by @inspired-geek.
- **Meilisearch OOM on large reindex** (#440) - full reindex now uses cursor-based pagination (1000 rows per batch) instead of loading all artifacts into memory. Download count subquery scoped to batch. `MeiliService::new` returns `Result` instead of panicking. Based on contribution by @inspired-geek.
- **Advisory cache silent error swallowing** (#439) - replaced `if let Ok` patterns with `match` + `warn!` logging for OSV and GitHub advisory API deserialization failures. Added bounded cache eviction. Based on contribution by @inspired-geek.
- **S3 backend error propagation** (#410) - improved status code handling and fallback error messages. Contributed by @inspired-geek.
- **Cargo sparse index field name** (#419) - renamed `version_req` to `req` in dependency entries to match the sparse registry protocol spec. Contributed by @inspired-geek.
- **Maven secondary GAV file serving** (#430) - resolve SNAPSHOT downloads and serve secondary files (POM, javadoc, sources) from the correct GAV path.
- **Maven SNAPSHOT checksum resolution** (#417) - resolve checksum requests for timestamped SNAPSHOT versions.
- **Maven GAV coordinate grouping** (#418) - group deploy artifacts by GAV coordinates to prevent incorrect artifact association.
